### Information:

- If you cloned this repository instead of downloading the zip from the releases page **and you do not want to help developing the pack**, you can safely delete all the files/directories **except** for:
	- assets/
	- pack.mcmeta
	- pack.png
	- README.md

- If you want to help developing the pack and use the scripts in the `.scripts` directory:
	- Make a copy of the `config.example.json` as `config.json` in the same directory and edit it to your configuration. 
	- On a normal configuration, only the `$root` variable needs to be changed to where you cloned the repository.
	- You also need to update the `client_jar` variable to the path of your Minecraft client jar.
